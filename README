# Rodinia Benchmark Suite

This variant leverages the CUDA runtime APIs for ACAI.

We use ocelot for the cuda runtime api. Due to compatibility issues of ocelot
for cuda > 5 we build all benchmarks with cuda 5. cuda 5 is only compatible with
gcc-4. Hence, we have to split compilation into two stages: cu -> cpp with
gcc 5. and cpp -> binary with cross compiler for arm. Build scripts of rodinia
are changed accordingly.


Requirements:
- gcc 4.4
- cuda 5
- cross compiler for arm
- gdev with runtime api (ocelot) integrated
